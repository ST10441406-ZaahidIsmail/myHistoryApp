The way this app works in practicality is that the the user will open the app, they will be promted to enter in an age, they then press clear to get rid of whats prompted and make space to enter in an input;
The user can then enter in an input and then press the generate button;
The app will then grab a value from whats coded in the app that matches the input and display an historial figure with a description of who they were and what they contributed to society;
In short, this app allows the user to enter an age, the app will then give an output of a historical figure who died at that age with a description of who they were and what they contribted to society.

For a clearer undeerstading, download android studio and create a demo version.
This a great app as it fits the roles of both educational and entertaining.
